        Hello and thank you for visiting my website, where I showcase some of the projects I have been working on during my career and free time.
        I got a PhD in data visualization from the University of Bergen, Norway, and currently I work at Magic Leap,
        where I aim to combine my knowledge of visualizations with that of 3D spatial computing.
        </p>

          Computers were always around me. Pictures captured me sitting in front of an Amiga when I was 1.5 years old.
          I played Lemmings, Monkey Island, and Giana Sisters in early years.
          When I got a graphical calculator in 8th grade, I began programming it in Basic.
          With my passion for computer games, I started my Bachelor's degree in computer science with a specialization in computer graphics.
          I enjoyed solving problems in all kinds of areas and my curiosity led me to study in a broad variety of fields,
          so that I wrote my thesis in artificial intelligence and started my Master's in high performance and cloud computing.
          I then discovered visualization as a topic that combines both visual appeal and problem solving.
          It was not only interesting enough to write my Master's thesis in the field, but further
          to pursue a PhD at the University of Bergen, Norway.
          There, I developed multiple web-based applications and visualization methods
          and performed research on the comparison of visualizations to find the best one for a given user, task, and dataset.
        </p>

          I love to play drums and volleyball.
          I like being outdoors, viewing nature, hiking the mountains around Bergen, or lying at a beach looking at the ocean.
          I still love video games.
        </p>
